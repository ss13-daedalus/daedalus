/*
	README:

	Data:

	>> space_ninja.dm << is this file. It contains a variety of procs related to either spawning space ninjas,
	modifying their verbs, various help procs, testing debug-related content, or storing unused procs for later.
	Similar functions should go into this file, along with anything else that may not have an explicit category.
	IMPORTANT: actual ninja suit, gloves, etc, are stored under the appropriate clothing files. If you need to change
	variables or look them up, look there. Easiest way is through the map file browser.

	>> ninja_abilities.dm << contains all the ninja-related powers. Spawning energy swords, teleporting, and the like.
	If more powers are added, or perhaps something related to powers, it should go there. Make sure to describe
	what an ability/power does so it's easier to reference later without looking at the code.
	IMPORTANT: verbs are still somewhat funky to work with. If an argument is specified but is not referenced in a way
	BYOND likes, in the code content, the verb will fail to trigger. Nothing will happen, literally, when clicked.
	This can be bypassed by either referencing the argument properly, or linking to another proc with the argument
	attached. The latter is what I like to do for certain cases--sometimes it's necessary to do that regardless.

	>> ninja_equipment.dm << deals with all the equipment-related procs for a ninja. Primarily it has the suit, gloves,
	and mask. The suit is by far the largest section of code out of the three and includes a lot of code that ties in
	to other functions. This file has gotten kind of large so breaking it up may be in order. I use section hearders.
	IMPORTANT: not much to say here. Follow along with the comments and adding new functions should be a breeze. Also
	know that certain equipment pieces are linked in other files. The energy blade, for example, has special
	functions defined in the appropriate files (airlock, securestorage, etc).

	General Notes:

	I created space ninjas with the expressed purpose of spicing up boring rounds. That is, ninjas are to xenos as marauders are to
	death squads. Ninjas are stealthy, tech-savvy, and powerful. Not to say marauders are all of those things, but a clever ninja
	should have little problem murderampaging their way through just about anything. Short of admin wizards maybe.
	HOWEVER!
	Ninjas also have a fairly great weakness as they require energy to use abilities. If, theoretically, there is a game
	mode based around space ninjas, make sure to account for their energy needs.

	Admin Notes:

	Ninjas are not admin PCs--please do not use them for that purpose. They are another way to participate in the game post-death,
	like pais, xenos, death squads, and cyborgs.
	I'm currently looking for feedback from regular players since beta testing is largely done. I would appreciate if
	you spawned regular players as ninjas when rounds are boring. Or exciting, it's all good as long as there is feedback.
	You can also spawn ninja gear manually if you want to.

	How to do that:
	Make sure your character has a mind.
	Change their assigned_role to "MODE", no quotes. Otherwise, the suit won't initialize.
	Change their special_role to "Space Ninja", no quotes. Otherwise, the character will be gibbed.
	Spawn ninja gear, put it on, hit initialize. Let the suit do the rest. You are now a space ninja.
	I don't recommend messing with suit variables unless you really know what you're doing.

	Miscellaneous Notes:

	Potential Upgrade Tree:
		Energy Shield:
			Extra Ability
			Syndicate Shield device?
				Works like the force wall spell, except can be kept indefinitely as long as energy remains. Toggled on or off.
				Would block bullets and the like.
		Phase Shift
			Extra Ability
			Advanced Sensors?
				Instead of being unlocked at the start, Phase Shieft would become available once requirements are met.
		Uranium-based Recharger:
			Suit Upgrade
			Unsure
				Instead of losing energy each second, the suit would regain the same amount of energy.
				This would not count in activating stealth and similar.
		Extended Battery Life:
			Suit Upgrade
			Battery of higher capacity
				Already implemented. Replace current battery with one of higher capacity.
		Advanced Cloak-Tech device.
			Suit Upgrade
			Syndicate Cloaking Device?
				Remove cloak failure rate.
